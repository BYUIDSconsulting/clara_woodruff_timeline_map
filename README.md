# Senior Project

For my senior project I worked with the Wilford Woodruff Papers to create a location analysis on the different places that Wilford Woodruff has written about. I created an interactive graph using leaflet, that allows users to view the different places that Wilford has written about over time and view how many times it was mentioned. 

My full analysis, code, and graph can be seen here: https://clarabrobergseniorproject.netlify.app/posts/final_project/
